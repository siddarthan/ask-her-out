# ask-her-out. An app I'm making just for fun. 

Apologies for making this look like the social network movie. This is gonna suck, but I have my hopes up. Here's my plan: 

#Log 1 - 12.09 AM, ask-her-out-app.com 
1. A Sinatra backend. 
2. A MongoDB database. 
3. HTML front-end (the web is still big, particularly when your iPhone is still under service).
4. Facebook Sign in. 

First up, I need to figure out how to set up Facebook login for an application running on my local host.
